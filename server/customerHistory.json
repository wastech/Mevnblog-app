They also urged Muslims to observe Jumaat prayers on Friday and also encouraged all Christians to have Easter church services with their full congregation on Sunday.Banky W reacted to the news via his Twitter page where he slammed them for making such a dangerous decision to relax the restrictions order despite the spread of the coronavirus. He wrote: “So for the State Governments that have suspended isolation & social distancing for Easter… do they have an agreement with the Coronavirus that it will also go on Easter break as well? These our “leaders” sha. Kai.”"
